#  AI Adoption in SaaS Product Management
**Capstone Project ‚Äì IIM Kozhikode (2025)**

##  Abstract
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is seen as a game-changer for SaaS product management, yet enterprise adoption lags behind the hype.
This project investigates the barriers to AI adoption‚Äîfocusing on the skills gap (67%) and data privacy concerns (33%)‚Äîthrough survey analytics, regression modeling, conjoint analysis, and focus group discussions.

 The project delivers a dual-strategy adoption playbook:
- Targeted Skills Enablement ‚Äî AI upskilling for PMs, engineers, and consultants
- Trust-centric Privacy Frameworks ‚Äî privacy-first positioning of AI

##  Objectives
- Identify barriers to adoption
- Quantify skills vs privacy impact
- Propose frameworks to accelerate adoption
- Deliver a practical playbook for SaaS leaders
